      <h1>About Diet-Checkerz</h1>
      <h6>
        Diet-Checkerz is a web application project created during Orbital 2021
        <br />
        Created by Louis (Y1, Information Security) and Gede Arya Chandradhana
        (Y2, Chemical Engineering)
        <br />
        <br />
        The creation of Diet-Checkerz is inspired by our personal health journey
        where our diets failed us.
        <br />
        We hope that this web application can be used to help people like us
        stay more disciplined in our diets and training.
        <br />
